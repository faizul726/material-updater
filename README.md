Or downgrade them as you wish.

parsing code ported to rust from the tool [MaterialBinTool](https://github.com/ddf8196/MaterialBinTool) made by [ddf8196](https://github.com/ddf8196)

## Usage
1. Download binary for your platform from [releases](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/material-updater/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive.
